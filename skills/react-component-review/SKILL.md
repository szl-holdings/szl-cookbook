# React Component Review

A focused review checklist for React components in this monorepo's web artifacts (Vite + React + TypeScript). Run `pre-flight-thinking` first if you are about to refactor based on findings.

## Correctness

- **Props are fully typed.** No implicit `any`, no missing required props.
- **Key props on lists.** Every `.map()` rendering JSX has a stable, unique `key` (not array index unless the list is static and never reordered).
- **Effect dependencies are complete.** All values used inside `useEffect` / `useCallback` / `useMemo` appear in the dependency array, or are stable refs.
- **No stale closure bugs.** State read inside a timeout or event listener uses a ref if the timeout outlives the render cycle.
- **Error boundaries.** Any component fetching data or rendering dynamic user content is wrapped (or its parent is) in an error boundary.

## Performance

- **Memoization is justified.** `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` are used only where profiling or clear reasoning shows benefit — not by default.
- **Large lists are virtualized.** Lists rendering > 100 items use a windowing solution (e.g., `@tanstack/react-virtual`).
- **Images have explicit dimensions.** `<img>` tags include `width` and `height` to prevent layout shift.
- **Heavy imports are lazy.** `React.lazy` + `Suspense` for routes and heavy third-party components not needed on initial paint.

## Accessibility

- **Interactive elements are keyboard-reachable.** Buttons, links, and custom controls have `tabIndex` managed correctly.
- **ARIA roles are accurate.** Custom widgets (tabs, dialogs, dropdowns) implement the correct ARIA pattern.
- **Color is not the only signal.** Error states, loading states, and status indicators have a text or icon fallback.
- **Focus is managed on modal open/close.**

## Code Hygiene

- **Component file is ≤ 300 lines.** Larger components should extract sub-components or hooks.
- **No inline object/array literals in JSX props** that create a new reference every render (unless the component is memoized by the parent or the prop is trivially cheap).
- **No direct DOM manipulation** (`document.querySelector`, `innerHTML`) inside React components — use refs.
