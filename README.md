> A measurable governance operator on the receipt-bus σ-algebra of agentic AI — demonstrated through worked recipes with PAC-Bayes bounds, carlota-jo doctrine guards, and claude-code skills with full HARVEST_LOG provenance.

---

## What this is

**szl-cookbook** provides executable recipes and SKILL.md patterns for engineering teams building governed AI applications on the SZL substrate. Two flagship recipes demonstrate the full stack: `knot-calculus-v1` implements the khipu receipt DAG with a McAllester-1999 PAC-Bayes bound and TH11 knot-invariant verification; `anatomy-evolved-v1` covers the 8-organ anatomy with carlota-jo doctrine guards for adversarial prompt defense. Nine claude-code skills are provided with HARVEST_LOG provenance, each a `SKILL.md` agent-instruction pattern harvested from real production sessions.

## Why it matters

Governed AI requires more than a policy engine — it requires executable examples that engineers can copy, adapt, and verify. szl-cookbook closes the gap between the Ouroboros Thesis formal guarantees and working code: every recipe is `tsc --noEmit` clean, references specific Lean obligations by theorem name, and carries a sealed date. The Doctrine v11 ban-word CI check runs on every push.

## Quickstart

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm exec:recipe governance/policy-gate-scaffold
pnpm doctrine:check   # Doctrine v11 ban-word sweep
```

Run the knot-calculus demo:

```bash
cd recipes/knot-calculus-v1/code
npx tsx tests/demo.ts
# Prints: khipu root receipt → knot-invariant tag → PAC-Bayes bound → TH11 failure demo
```

## Doctrine v11

A ban-word CI check runs on every push via `.github/workflows/doctrine.yml`. The full list of prohibited superlatives is defined in the workflow file. Any match causes CI failure.
