# SZL Cookbook

**The first-touch resource for using the five SZL flagships.**
Worked, runnable recipes — each verified end-to-end against the live mesh, each carrying its own receipt.

## What this is

The SZL Cookbook is to the SZL platform what the
[Anthropic Cookbook](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook),
[OpenAI Cookbook](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook), and
[Hugging Face Cookbook](https://github.com/huggingface/cookbook) are to theirs: a library of
copy-paste-able recipes that show, concretely, **how to use the products**. Here the products are
the five governance organs — **a11oy, sentra, amaru, killinchu, rosie** — and every recipe is
grounded in a *verified live artifact*, not a slideware claim.

The signature first recipe — **[Verify a receipt end-to-end](recipes/01-verify-a-receipt-end-to-end.md)**
— cryptographically validates a real ECDSA-P256 DSSE signature from the public
[`szl-lake`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SZLHOLDINGS/szl-lake) dataset in under a minute, with
zero credentials. That is the whole promise of the platform, made runnable.

## ⚡ Quickstart (60 seconds)

```python
import base64, json, urllib.request
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import ec
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.utils import Prehashed
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes, serialization

LAKE = "https://huggingface.co/datasets/SZLHOLDINGS/szl-lake/resolve/main"
r = json.loads(urllib.request.urlopen(f"{LAKE}/khipu/amaru_receipts.ndjson").readline())
pub = serialization.load_pem_public_key(
    urllib.request.urlopen("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/szl-holdings/.github/main/cosign.pub").read())

pub.verify(base64.b64decode(r["dsse_sig"]), bytes.fromhex(r["dsse_pae_sha256"]),
           ec.ECDSA(Prehashed(hashes.SHA256())))        # raises if invalid
print("VALID:", r["receipt_id"][:16], "signed by", r["dsse_keyid"])
# => VALID: 4c9c3f2b8d6452d9 signed by szlholdings-cosign
```

## 📖 Recipes

Each recipe has a hero hook + headline number, quickstart code, a full walkthrough, a BibTeX block,
and "see also" links. Recipes marked **live** run against the deployed Spaces today.

## 🤝 Used by

The cookbook recipes are the customer first-touch path into the SZL platform. They are referenced
from:

- The [SZL Holdings org profile](https://github.com/szl-holdings) (landing page).
- The [SZL docs site](https://docs.szlholdings.com) cookbook section.
- Each flagship README's "Try the cookbook recipe" callout.
- Each [Hugging Face Space](https://huggingface.co/SZLHOLDINGS) card's "Cookbook recipes for this Space" section.

## 🔍 Honesty policy

Every recipe shows only what **actually works end-to-end** against the live flagships. Where a step
needs founder credentials or a private resource, it says so plainly:

- **Λ is Conjecture 1**, not a theorem (open `CAUCHY_ND` sorry + missing symmetry axiom). No recipe
  claims otherwise.
- **Doctrine 749/14/163 is LOCKED** at kernel `c7c0ba17`. The cookbook *references* these artifacts;
  it never changes them.
- **SLSA L1 (honest)** — image signing is keyless cosign + public Rekor (recipe 06). Live-Space
  *runtime* receipt signatures are still `PLACEHOLDER` (Sigstore CI pending); the lake receipt used
  in recipe 01 carries a *real* signature that verifies.
- **Cardano** anchoring is demo-seeded, not on-chain mainnet; testnet/mainnet submission needs
  founder credentials (recipe 10).
- **Telemetry** (Remote-ID/ADS-B/MAVLink) is unauthenticated — decoded fields are *claims*, never
  ground truth (recipe 04).
